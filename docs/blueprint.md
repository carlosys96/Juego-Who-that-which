## Core Features:

- Interactive Question Generation: Dynamically generate fill-in-the-blanks-style questions that test the user's knowledge of the appropriate use of 'that,' 'which,' and 'who.' Incorporates varied question types (multiple choice, drag and drop, true/false, timed).
- Adaptive Difficulty: Increase or decrease the difficulty based on the user's previous performance, and introduce level changes every 5 questions, offering dynamic difficulty scaling.  In addition, implement a tool for adapting the questions based on historical performance from other users, identifying problematic questions and providing them more often.
- Real-time Feedback System: Provide real-time positive/negative audio feedback after each question, with the option to toggle background music on/off. Integrate progress bar for level progression and visual rewards such as stars or trophies on completing sections.
- High Score Tracking: Maintain high scores locally in the user's browser, tracking it by player name.
- Teacher Admin Panel: Allow teachers to log in using the password '270219' and get the game settings as a downloadable CSV file.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the game is fully responsive and compatible with both desktop and mobile devices, for flexibility.
